Take control of your finances directly in the browser with Budget Buddy, your personal finance companion. 

Simply add your spending categories, such as clothes, skincare, and groceries, and allocate a budget to each category to stay on track with your financial goals.

Budget Buddy automatically injects a clickable icon onto many product pages, helping remind shoppers be aware of their budget before potentially making a new purchase. By clicking on the icon, users can easily view and update their budget in a side panel on their current webpage in real-time, no tab switching or extra windows required! Budget Buddy is also accessible as a popup element and can be pinned to the extensions toolbar for easy access no matter what page you're on currently.
